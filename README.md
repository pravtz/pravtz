# Hello, I'm Ederson O Pravtz

I am a student of Analysis in systems development, I really like codes and agoritimos.

## Summary of my story

I started programming in the time when the internet was still dial-up. I went through many challenges, but along my trajectory I developed many web projects using the resources that were available. But only recently I started taking programming as a profession. My goal is to become a reference in the area, to make a difference in this world that I feel more and more excited every day.
Despite having started to program with PHP and having carried out several projects with it. Today JavaScript (NodeJs, Typescript) fascinates me. I am proud to say that I am a programmer.
I hope that in the same way that I was infected with this technological magic, I can share knowledge and enthusiasm.

## My currently published projects

- **cli-bitcoin** => that brings information via the command line of the cryptocurrency world.
- **App-tour “tour.pravtz.com.br”** => Tourism application that shows photos of the most visited places in Porto Alegre
- **“pravtz.netlify.app”** => Blog made in Gatsby wants to exercise the knowledge of GRAPHQL and the use of cms like Netlify

## In recent years, I have delved into:
- Basic tools like: git, babel, webpack, prettier, eslint...;
- Styling tools like: Styled Component, Tailwind, Stitches;
- Data fetching com: SWR e GRAPHQL;
- Relational database;
- NodeJs;
- Framewords like React, Nextjs and Remix
- Automated tests (mocha, jest, cypress);
